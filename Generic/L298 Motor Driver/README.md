ESP32 L298N Motor Driver Control
A simple guide to controlling DC motors with an ESP32 and the L298N H-bridge motor driver module, using the ESP32's LEDC peripheral for PWM-based speed control.
---
What is the L298N?
The L298N is a dual H-bridge motor driver IC, meaning it can independently control two DC motors — both speed and direction. It accepts a logic-level input (3.3V or 5V) making it compatible with the ESP32 straight out of the box.
---
Pin Overview
The L298N has two types of control pins:
ENA / ENB — Enable pins for Motor A and Motor B. These accept a PWM signal to control motor speed. A higher duty cycle = faster motor. With the ESP32, these are driven using the LEDC peripheral.
IN1 / IN2 — Direction control for Motor A
IN3 / IN4 — Direction control for Motor B
---
Direction Control Truth Table
IN1	IN2	Motor A Behaviour
LOW	LOW	Off (coasting)
HIGH	LOW	Forward
LOW	HIGH	Reverse
HIGH	HIGH	Brake (motor locked)
The same logic applies to IN3 / IN4 for Motor B.
> **Note:** ENA/ENB must have a non-zero PWM value for the motor to actually move, even if the direction pins are set correctly.

| +12V     | Motor supply                     | 7–35V DC motor power                  |
| +5V (out)| 3.3V via regulator / 5V pin      | See note below                        |
⚡ Powering the ESP32 from the L298N
The L298N has an onboard 5V regulator that outputs 5V on its +5V pin (when the jumper is in place). This can be used to power the ESP32 directly via its VIN pin, removing the need for a separate USB or power supply for the microcontroller. Just make sure the motor supply voltage is within the regulator's supported range (typically up to ~35V, and at least ~7V for the regulator to output a stable 5V).

Code Explained
```cpp
// ESP32 L298N Motor Control — using LEDC for PWM
```
Pin definitions at the top assign GPIO numbers to each L298N control pin for both motors.
PWM config sets up a 2000 Hz PWM signal with 8-bit resolution (values 0–255) — this is fed into ENA and ENB to control motor speed.
In `setup()`:
All direction pins (IN1–IN4) are set as outputs and initialised LOW (motors off)
`ledcAttachChannel()` binds ENA and ENB to their respective LEDC channels
`ledcWrite()` sets initial speed to 0
In `loop()`:
Both motors are set to full speed (`255`) via `ledcWrite()`
Direction pins are set HIGH/LOW to drive both motors forward
Then direction pins are flipped to reverse both motors
```cpp
// Full speed forward
ledcWrite(ENA, 255);
ledcWrite(ENB, 255);
digitalWrite(in1, HIGH); digitalWrite(in2, LOW);   // Motor A forward
digitalWrite(in3, HIGH); digitalWrite(in4, LOW);   // Motor B forward

// Reverse
digitalWrite(in1, LOW);  digitalWrite(in2, HIGH);  // Motor A reverse
digitalWrite(in3, LOW);  digitalWrite(in4, HIGH);  // Motor B reverse
```
To set an intermediate speed, replace `255` with any value between `0` and `255`.
